## How to use
First of all you need a [Biskuit](https://github.com/biskuitorg/biskuit) installation. This theme is not offered as a package and cannot be installed in the official way in Biskuit. You need to fetch the latest git to `/packages/linuxhubit/v4` and enable it from the settings table in your database.

## Disclaimer
This theme is not compatible with Biskuit 2. If you're looking for a theme for Biskuit 2, check out [Butter](https://github.com/biskuitorg/butter), the official theme. With the v5 of the theme, work will start for the conversion to Biskuit 2, the theme will be based on Butter.
